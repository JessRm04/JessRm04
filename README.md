### Hi there, it's Jess! 👋
I'm Jess, a Full-Stack Developer in progress. Here you can look at my apprenticeship :)


## About me :octocat:

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project education/social related

- 📫 You can reach me at my 👉 [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-rios-maneiro/) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not knowing I'd learn web development at some point of my life, I worked A LOT bringing people closer to technology, as I always have trusted in tech to solve real life problems.
